Taisei v1.4.2 Released!

This is another maintenance release without gameplay changes, but one that comes with quite a few bug
fixes and a significant overhaul for gamepad input. If you're playing on a gamepad, please take a look
into the new settings under the Options menu!

For a more comprehensive list of changes, visit the
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/releases/tag/v1.4.2).

As usual, you can find the update in the [downloads section](/download). Note that the Flatpak build may
take a few days to get updated.
