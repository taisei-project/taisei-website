Release Time!
Today, after a week full of careful (\*cough\*) testing, we are ready to announce the first stable version of Taisei.
It was quite a long way and there is still quite some stuff to do, but I hope with this release Taisei will become known to a greater audience for the first time.


So just be sure you enjoy playing… and consider joining us on IRC!
