A Website for Taisei
Spontaneous project this weekend: Making a website for the project. But soon i had to realize that something like a "good CMS" for my purposes does not exist. So I ended up programming my own using Go and its http capabilities. I call it "GO Obviously Dreadful CMS" or in short GoodCMS.
I generally focussed on something minimalistic and highly extensible. At the moment I have about 300 SLOC for everything here. It just reads some ini-style config data and fills the Macros in my little boilerplate file with the content from my content files, but for me it is exactly what I needed.

I hope this page will be a place for people to get a first impression of the project. Screenshots and poorly drawn media are to follow.
