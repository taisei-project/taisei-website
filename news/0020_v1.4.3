Taisei v1.4.3 Released!

This is yet another maintenance release without any gameplay changes. However, it contains some important
fixes and rendering backend improvements, especially for Windows and macOS users.

Some key changes are:

- **New rendering backend based on the SDL3-GPU API**. In practice, it means the game will now use the
modern Vulkan and Metal graphics APIs on Windows and macOS by default, respectively. This greatly improves
compatibility and performance. On Linux and other systems, OpenGL is still the default, as it's well
supported and currently more efficient, thanks to the excellent Mesa drivers.
- **ANGLE mode is gone**, as it is no longer needed due to the previous change.
- **Fixed a game-breaking bug** that may exist in some builds of the game, causing it to crash on Wriggle's
"Moonlight Rocket" Spell Card.
- **Fixed another crash** that occurred when the game window is closed during the game over menu.
- **32-bit Windows builds are no longer provided**. You can still build them yourself, but this is unsupported.
All x86 hardware that Taisei could be playable on is 64-bit-capable.
- **Fixed the Windows .exe missing the icon and metadata**. Oops!
- **Improved the web browser version's UI**. The game window is always maximized to the page content, and
switching into fullscreen mode should work more reliably now.

For a more comprehensive list of changes, visit the
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/releases/tag/v1.4.3).

As usual, you can find the update in the [downloads section](/download). Note that the update is currently
not available for the Switch homebrew. The new version depends on SDL3, which has not been fully ported to
that platform yet.

**UPDATE**: unfortunately, the macOS build is currently broken, so the download page links to the old (working)
v1.4.2 until a fix is available. Sorry for the inconvenience.
