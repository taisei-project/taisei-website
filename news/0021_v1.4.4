Taisei v1.4.4 Released!

This is a maintenance release that is meant to fix some regressions introduced in the previous (ill-fated)
version 1.4.3.

In particular:

- **The macOS build works again**. The previous version would instantly crash.
- **Fixed audio distortion** when the audio device uses a sample rate other than 48 kHz.
- **Fixed slightly increased audio latency** on some systems.

For a more comprehensive list of changes, visit the
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/releases/tag/v1.4.4).

As usual, you can find the update in the [downloads section](/download). Note that the Switch homebrew
build remains unavailable due to the missing SDL3 port.
