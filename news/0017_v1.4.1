Taisei v1.4.1 Released!

Continuing the tradition of long overdue releases, here comes **Taisei v1.4.1**. This is a
maintenance release without any gameplay changes. It fixes a few bugs that caused crashes under
some conditions and makes some minor optimizations, mostly for the sake of slightly faster rewinds
when using the quick save/load functionality. A more comprehensive list of changes is available
on the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/releases/tag/v1.4.1).

Find the latest update in the [downloads section](/download). Note that the Flatpak and web builds
may take a few days to get updated.
